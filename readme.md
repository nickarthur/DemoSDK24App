# iOS SDK for Scosche Rhythm series sensors

This SDK and Demo app will help integrate the Rhythm series sensors and the detailed fitness data into your own app.


### Rhythm+ And Rhythm 24 Sensors

Rhythm24™ optically measures blood flow and body movement to ensure the most accurate data possible. With its dual-mode radio you can simultaneously transmit your heart rate to multiple ANT+ displays (Garmin® watches, cycling computers, fitness equipment and more) and to your favorite Bluetooth® Smart enabled watch or smartphone app. [More Info](https://www.scosche.com/rhythm24)

### Bluetooth® Smart and ANT+
Great for use with smartphones, tablets, smart and sport watches, exercise equipment and many other devices that support Bluetooth® Smart or ANT+ heart rate data.

# Getting Started
This repositorty contains the demo app source code as well as a local cocoapod for the Scosche Framework. 

### Build dependancies
* Xcode 10.1 and above
* Cocoapods 1.0 and above
* Physical iOS device with BLE to test (Note: Simulator does not have a BLE radio)
* Scosche Rhythm+ or Rhythm 24 sensor


### Setting up local CocoaPod SDK
* Download the Scosche SDK24 Cocoapod. 
* If need be, unzip the packaged file
* Move to a directory of your choosing


### Setting up Demo File for testing
* Download the Scosche DEMOSDK24 Zip
* If need be, unzip the packaged file
* Move to a directory of your choosing
* modify the podfile in the DEMOSDK24 directory to connect it to the SDK24 cocoapod folder/

### PodFile
In the DEMOSDK24 folder you will find a file called `podfile`. Open this file and change the path to the directory where you downloaded the SDK24 to. Note this can be inside of a GIT repository or outside depending on your methods.
```
platform :ios, '12.0'

target 'Demo' do
  use_frameworks!

  pod 'ScoscheSDK24', :path => '/Users/Your_Unique_Path/SDK24/'

end

post_install do |installer|
    installer.pods_project.build_configurations.each do |config|
        config.build_settings.delete('CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED')
        config.build_settings.delete('CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED')
    end
end
```
After modifying the podfile. Open Terminal and type the following into the command line.
* __cd__ to the DEMOSDK24 folder where the podfile is located (Note: you can drag and drop the podfile into terminal to generate the path. You will just need to remove the `/podfile` from the path after it appears)
* pod install


### Setting up Demo File for testing
Open the `Demo.xcworkspace` file that has been generated by cocoapods. The SDK24 framework and its dependancies will be added to the pod folder. 

The demo id broken up into 5 views to show the different parts of the SDK.
First is the `scanViewController`  BLE scanner view. This screen scans for Scosche Rhythm sensors and if found displays the name of the device. 

Once connected, the SDK starts listing for BLE advertisements and routes this data to any `ScoscheViewController`. The `ScoscheViewController` view type allows any view to have base level data from a sensor. The data is collected and available as public vars within this view type.

The second view is `dataViewController` and this is an example of a connected `ScoscheViewController`. The data is displayed in the demo as simple UITableView rows. This data can however be used as your UI needs dictate. Whether an intricate dashboard or a single large heartrate display. The data is at your fingertips and updates as the sensor updates. 

The third and fourth example views modify the `SportModeType` modes and the `ScoscheUserInfo` data. 

The fifth view `workoutViewController` example list all recorded workouts on the sensor (Rhythm 24 only).

### ScoscheViewController
Below is a list of data that can be used in any ScoscheView Controller Simply by passing in `monitor: ScoscheMonitor = chosen sensor`. Monitor is a shared object and can be set internally or globally as needed.
